# Project Roadmap

This document describes upcoming milestones for the Lyra project. The roadmap may evolve, but it provides a high-level view of planned work.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Establish the package layout under `core/`, `modules/`, `data/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`.
- Create minimal placeholders so the repository is installable as a Python package.
- Outline guidelines for contributing modules and data.

## Phase 2: Feature Development
- Implement the core logic within the `core` package.
- Add specialized components in `modules` to extend base functionality.
- Provide example datasets in `data` for experimentation.
- Build an automated test suite inside `tests`.

## Phase 3: Stabilization & Release
- Polish APIs and ensure backward compatibility.
- Expand documentation with tutorials and in-depth guides.
- Complete comprehensive tests and continuous integration.
- Prepare versioned releases and publish the project.

This roadmap will be updated as the project grows. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
